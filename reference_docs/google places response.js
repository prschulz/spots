I really like the way they put their salads together: greens (mixed, iceberg, butter, spinach, kale), staples (croutons, beets, cheeses, carrots, etc), premiums (candied walnuts, mushrooms, etc), and protein (chicken, salmon, tuna, turkey, steak).  They have a good variety of dressings, and everything seems to be really high quality.  \n\nCons:  It's a little on the spendy side, but the biggest problem is the line.  Good lord, the line.  It can seriously take 30 minutes just to get in and out of this place.  Is any salad really worth 30 minutes?  \n\nUltimately I really like this place and I want to go again, but it's one of those places where you have to be strategic or lose most of your lunch break to the line game. \n\nMy order:  Spinach, chicken, caramelized onions, beets, spicy peanuts, goat cheese, avocado, balsamic vinaigrette.
